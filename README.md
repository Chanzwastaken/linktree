![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eee4bab0-c5fb-4c39-bf8d-88cd686d16db)

This project is a simple, responsive links page that showcases various social media profiles and features a moving rainbow background animation. The page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS animations to create a dynamic and visually appealing interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Background:** A moving rainbow gradient that shifts as the user interacts with the page (tilting the device).
- **Profile Links:** Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube profiles.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Adjusts based on device orientation, using the device's tilt to animate the background.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Custom animations)**
- **Bootstrap 5**
- **JavaScript (Device orientation detection)**

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the page.
3. Modify the profile image (`Chanzalytics_logo.jpeg`) or links to reflect your personal branding and social profiles.

### How to Edit

- To change the social media links, replace the URLs in the `<a>` tags with your desired destinations.
- To change the profile image, replace `Chanzalytics_logo.jpeg` with your image file or update the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag.
