This project is a modern, dynamic, and responsive links page designed to showcase your social media profiles and provide an interactive experience. It features a unique rainbow background that responds to device orientation and includes a fully functional, interactive chatbot.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern UI:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, sleek design and seamless responsiveness across all devices.
- **Dynamic Animations:** The page includes a variety of subtle animations to bring it to life, such as a floating card, a glowing shadow, and a staggered fade-in effect for the links.
- **Interactive Background:** A smooth, moving rainbow gradient that shifts based on your device's tilt (for mobile users).
- **Embedded Chatbot:** A fully functional chatbot is available in the bottom-right corner, allowing visitors to ask questions directly from the page.
- **Clickable Links with Icons:** Links to your social profiles are enhanced with **Font Awesome** icons, making them more visually appealing.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Custom Animations & Tailwind CSS)
- **JavaScript** (Device Orientation & Gemini API Integration)
- **Font Awesome** (for social media icons)

## üîß Usage

1.  **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.
2.  **Open the `index.html`** file in your web browser to view the page.
3.  To use the chatbot, you must get an API key from the Gemini API and paste it into the `apiKey` variable in the script.

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Edit

The entire project is contained within a single `index.html` file, making it easy to customize.

-   **Change Links and Text:** Simply replace the URLs and text within the `<a>` tags and `<p>` tags to match your desired content.
-   **Update Profile Image:** The profile image uses a placeholder URL. To use your own, replace the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag with a hosted image URL.
-   **Customize Chatbot:** You can change the chatbot's prompt in the JavaScript to give it a specific persona or knowledge base.
